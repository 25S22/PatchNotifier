Subject: Request for OpManager Availability Reports and Integration with QRadar

Hi OpManager Team,

Hope you're doing well.

We’re currently working on improving how we manage and verify device status between QRadar and OpManager. We’ve noticed that QRadar sometimes marks devices as “inactive” due to no events being sent, even though OpManager shows them as up and reachable. Since OpManager provides more accurate availability data, we plan to use it as the reference to fix these false alerts in QRadar.

To support this, we’d like to request the following:

Weekly Availability or Health Reports:
A regular report or access to data showing the last known “up” status of devices to confirm if QRadar’s “inactive” tags are valid or not.

API Access:
Access to OpManager’s API and relevant documentation so we can automatically check device status and sync it with QRadar.

Integration Possibilities:
If possible, we’d like to explore integration options where OpManager can directly update QRadar—whether through syslogs or any supported method—to help automatically handle false inactive alerts and reflect newly added devices.

Looking forward to your support and inputs on how best to proceed.

Best regards,
